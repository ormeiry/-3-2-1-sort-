# -3-2-1-sort-

A sorting visualization web app
All you need to do is to generate an array,
Pick the size of the array and the speed you want the sorting algorithm to move in!
Don't forget to pick the sorting algorithm itself :)

For this project I used:
HTML , CSS, JavaScript and the p5 JavaScript library for the animations
